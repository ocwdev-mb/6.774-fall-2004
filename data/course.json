  "course_title": "Physics of Microfabrication: Front End Processing",
  "course_description": "This course is offered to graduates and focuses on understanding the fundamental principles of the \"front-end\" processes used in the fabrication of devices for silicon integrated circuits. This includes advanced physical models and practical aspects of major processes, such as oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation, and epitaxy. Other topics covered include: high performance MOS and bipolar devices including ultra-thin gate oxides, implant-damage enhanced diffusion, advanced metrology, and new materials such as Silicon Germanium (SiGe).\n",
